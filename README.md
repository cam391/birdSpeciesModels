# birdSpeciesModels
This repository holds the code for a machine learning term project for UNC's STOR 565.

Within the repository you can find the project proposal and final presentation, as well as the EDA and models we used in our project.

Please note the some of the models are extremely computationaly complex (memory intensive) and may crash your machine.

Also note that some of these files have not been changed after being moved from a computing cluster, and may not run (updates coming soon).
